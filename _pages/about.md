I am currently a college student in Heilongjiang University of Science and Technology. I am about to get my B.Eng degree in Computer Science and Technology and B.Sc Mathematics and Applied Mathematics. I am ready go to NUI, Galway to pursue my M.Sc degree in Artificial Intelligence this autumn.

As a student major in computer science, I am really into programming. Moreover, Mathematics, as a basic discipline can be combined to CS, also attract me. With my tutor's support and motivation, I took part in some mathematical modelling competition through my undergradutate period and got some prizes.

Machine learing, which relies on computer skills and mathematical knowledge and can be applied to our daily life, is my favourate research area. I hope to be a researcher in this field.

My research interests are as follows:
<br>·Machine Learning Based on Optimization Algorithm    
<br>·Applied Machine Learning
<br>·Computer Vision
